Introducing my end-game keyboard (maybe?):

![HHKB](/img/hhkb.jpg)

Name: HHKB Type-S  
Switch: 45g Topre Silenced  
Keycap: PBT

Additional Keycaps:

- PFU Color Key Top Set (PD-KB400KT01)
- Massdrop Topre PBT Space Bar ([https://www.massdrop.com/buy/topre-pbt-spacebar](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/topre-pbt-spacebar))
- Artisan Keycap 'Trooper - Black Red' ([https://www.hotkeysproject.com/products/trooper-black-red](https://www.hotkeysproject.com/products/trooper-black-red))

As of today (7/19/2018), the artisan keycap is still available on the website. It was shipped from Hong Kong and took about 10 days to deliver (pretty satisfied about the shipping comparing to 3 months for the PFU one).

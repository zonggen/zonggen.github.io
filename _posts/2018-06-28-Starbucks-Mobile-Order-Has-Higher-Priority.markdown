Finally I finished my midterms this week. The midterms were not hard but really require some work to prepare. CSC263 was a fair game with some expected stuff (*Average difficulty*). CSC343 and MAT235 were *easier* than expected (especially MAT235). Anyway, I finally have time to think about my next project. For next project, it might be a google extension but I'm not sure about the content yet.    

Recently I've been drinking a lot of Starbucks (mostly Triple-Shot Iced Latte). I found that mobile order is far faster than in-store order. It seems like Starbucks will put the mobile order at the first of the *__List__* or at the top of the *__Stack__* whenever they received it. I might be wrong but will do some tests to verify it.

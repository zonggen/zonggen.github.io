![Project Structure]({{ "/assets/img/posts/project-structure.png" | absolute_url }} "Project Structure")

Because of the [acquisition](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-unveils-roadmap-coreos-integration-red-hat-openshift), the project structure confused me quite a lot. Plus the on-board documentation is so lengthy..ish. Above is the summary of my understanding of our project structure 
after some research. Please correct me if I'm wrong, and also I might update this throughout the my internship @Red Hat FCOS team.

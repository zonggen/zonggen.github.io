These two days I have been learning Rust. Unlike Javascript, I would love to
learn Rust more throughly since multiple of our projects uses Rust and we are
also planning to migrate to Rust for coreos-assembler so it might be very helpful
to have good fundamentals.  
Here is a summary of unique feature that Rust has comparing to C, Java, Python and Haskell, to
which Rust somewhat resembles in some way:
 - Rust prevent memory vulnerabilities by taking ownership of memeory (aka one heap memory chunk
 belongs to only one control block)
 - Lifetimes of references
 - No `null` value in Rust

Similarities with Haskell: Monads  
Similarity to functional programming languages: Iterators, Closures, Memoiization (Lazy Evaluation)  
Similarities with Java: Traits (Interfaces), Generic Types

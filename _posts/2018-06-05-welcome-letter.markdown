This is my first exercise of website development.  

I did not intend to build a blogging website. I was reading through the tutorial at [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) about building a static website.  

Then it leads me to **Jekyll** which is a static website generator written in **Ruby**. In my opinion, Jekyll is a handy and simple framework that would get you started on the way of Web Development.  

Next, I'm going to refine the styling of this website step by step. Hopefully, by the end of this summer I would have a better functional and more beautiful website.  

Cheers!   &#9996;
